# Openai Finetuning
intended to assist in finetuning GPT modells [https://platform.openai.com/finetune]

#### why finetune? :(assume everything i say to be wrong) 
You have two way to manipulate/enhance LLMs; that being RAG and finetuning. Both may reduce hallucination risk, but finetuning is better for behavior, style, tone, abilities whereas RAG is employing abilities to verify or inform models.
